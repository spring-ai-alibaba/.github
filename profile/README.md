üöÄ Spring AI Alibaba is dedicated to providing a framework and ecosystem for Java developers to build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents.

## Spring AI Alibaba's Ecosystem

 Projects | Description | Usage Guide
  --- | --- | ---
| [Spring AI Alibaba Agent Framework](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba/tree/main/spring-ai-alibaba-agent-framework) |  üöÄ Framework for building agent and multi-agent applications, with embedded context engineering support.  | Focus on Agent building, using </br> - Graph as the runtime </br> - Spring AI as the LLM model. 
| [Spring AI Alibaba Graph](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba/tree/main/spring-ai-alibaba-graph-core) | A low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. | For advanced use cases that need more control over the Agent or Multi-agent process.
| [Spring AI Alibaba Admin](https://github.com/spring-ai-alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba-admin) |  Local visualization toolkit for the development of agent applications, supporting project management, runtime visualization, tracing, and agent evaluation. | Visualized tool for agents built with Agent Framework or Graph.
| [Spring AI Extensions](https://github.com/spring-ai-alibaba/spring-ai-extensions) | Extended implementations for Spring AI core concepts, including DashScopeChatModel, MCP registry, etc. |  Extension for Spring AI, providing basic abstraction for building LLM applications, for example, model, tool, mcp, vector store, etc.
